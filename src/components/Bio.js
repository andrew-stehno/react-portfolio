        I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in communication and
        training, which allows me to better understand the needs of customers,
        and to coordinate tasks within a group setting. I’ve earned a
        certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Utah, with
        developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, React, Git and
        responsive web design. Having Spent my entire career working directly
        with high-value customers and peers, I’m confident that I can bring my
        interpersonal and leadership skills to the table, along with my
        technical know-how, to be a part of a cohesive, results-oriented team.
        Most recently, as a Project Manager on a team of four, I was able to
        coordinate and oversee the development of an app which allows diabetics
        to log and track their daily blood glucose levels in a convenient chart.
        This application was built on a MERN stack. Through communication,
        dividing responsibilities up according to individual strengths, and
        tracking production through the use of a kanban board, our team was able
        to put forth a fully functional and mobily responsive product. I enjoy
        being part of the collabortive process, and seeing projects develop from
        an idea, to production. I’m excited to continue making life enabling web
        content, to continue learning, and to be a part of a meaningful
        organization, where I can use my expertise to solve tomorrow’s problems,
        today.
